Writing tests shouldn't be so bad actually!

If you are testing something to do with the game, then place your test in the gameTests package.
Each test will be a class with a main method. These mini programs are supposed to test specific things so 
they should be extremely small in size. Please name your test class to be what you're testing (makes sense right?). So
 if for example you happen to be testing the display create a file called DisplayTest.java with a main method...


 public class DisplayTest{

    public static void main(String args[]){
        //Code here
        subTest1();
    }

    public subTest1(){

    }



 }
