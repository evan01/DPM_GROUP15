# DPM_GROUP15
This repository will hold the code for the Design Principles and Methods project

In order for us all to work together, we have to do some setup. Here's the scoop.

We all have different versions of eclipse and different locations for things on our computer. The only thing that we actually need to share is all of our code. Everything else, like your eclipse prefferences (generated for you when you make a project) we don't actually need (lets hope).

What we are going to do is set up our eclipse in such a way that we share the src folder.

The goal is that you can open the Github desktop app, press sync, and then you will get the latest changes to our 'shared src folder', and begin to contribute to it as well!

After you press the sync button, you can open eclipse and all of the new files and folders that were created by other people will be there.

Before we do this however, some setup has to happen.

###SETUP
1. Open eclipse
2. Go to file>switch worskpace and open up the DPM_GROUP15 folder
3. Hopefully you should see the lastest code and such there... 


###NORMAL USE
Just open the github app and press sync when you want to get what's in the remote repository (our shared folder online)
If you make some changes, commit them in the github app with a message with what you did (TRY NOT TO COMMIT REALLY USELESS CHANGES, but commiting often is a good thing :)

IF something breaks or doesn't work just message me and hopefully we can fix it. It's hard to mess up with git because even if you do mess up you should always be able to get back to a previous version of things.
https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing/syncing-your-branch/ will also work when things don't quite work out
You can ask someone at github to help you out :)
That's it! Cheers!
Evan
